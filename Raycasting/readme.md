* Raycasting

Just found this page about [Raycasting](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html "Raycasting") and then I put down some code for my STM32F7-Disco board.

I follow the code from the site, just do some hack to speedup.

There is a Keil project and the .HEX file to burn. Also, inside the Keil project, there are two little program I use to convert the texture files from RGB to ARGB. Then I use bin2h to convert the files to header. But inside the project there are all the files.

There is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frlnuFKJmX4 "Raycasting")

Many Thanks to Lode Vandevenne for the tutorial.
